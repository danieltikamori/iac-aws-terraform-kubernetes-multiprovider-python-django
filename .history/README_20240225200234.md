# Infrastructure as Code with Terraform, AWS and Kubernetes deploying Python - Django API application

## Why this stack?

### Terraform?

Avoid manual mistakes, more control over the deployments, and more portability.

### Why AWS?

Reduce CAPEX and accelerate deployment time. You can choose another platform or use hybrid

### Why Kubernetes?

As an open-source project, you can use it in various environments. No strings attached to any vendor lock-in. You have full access to the source code.
For scalable applications that require a lot of resources (CPU/Memory). It's also a good choice for microservices.
For scalability and fault tolerance in a containerized environment.

## Preparing the environment

Install Terraform and AWS CLI.

Configure them.

Create a project directory and infra/, env/ and environment directories inside env/ directory.
